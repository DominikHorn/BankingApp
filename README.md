# About this Project
Banking App is a react app to parse .csv bank statements and display 
contained information in a neat and pretty graphical format.

You can find a live version [here](https://DominikHorn.github.io/BankingApp). Note that **your data never leaves your local device** since all magic happens purely through client side web technologies.
